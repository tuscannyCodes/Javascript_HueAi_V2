# Javascript_HueAi_V2
An updated version of the HueAi chatbot. 

This is Hue, the AI chatbot Ive been working on since the start of my coding journey. Hue is created using vanilla Javascript, and building it has really helped me understand how code works. The code is messy because as I said, Ive been building this from the start of my coding journey. The code here tells a story of me learning how to write and read Javascript. One day after I build Hue to how I fully want its functionality to be, I plan on refactoring the code to make everything cleaner and readable for anyone who wants to look under the hood. \
\
As it stand now, I am working on Hue's base functionality and fixing bugs.
